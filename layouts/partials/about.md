Elara is a game that teaches you how to code. It is named after one of the
[moons of Jupiter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elara_(moon)>) where the game takes
place.

It is still a work-in-progress. The current "public beta" version includes 25 levels,
teaches many core programming concepts, and features a complete story from start-to-end! However, some minor things like dialog, music, sound effects, and certain animations may feel incomplete. Elara is constantly being improved, and your feedback can help us make the
game as good as it can be ðŸ˜€

Elara is and always will be free and open source! The source code is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/albrow/elara).
