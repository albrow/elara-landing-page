##### Who is Elara for?

Elara is targeted toward middle school and high school students who do not have
any previous coding experience. But fret not! If you are a little older or already
have some coding experience, there's still plenty to enjoy. The game includes
optional challenges to really test your knowledge and make you think outside the
box.

##### Is it really free?

Yes! Elara is completely free and we plan to keep it that way.

It's also [open source](https://github.com/albrow/elara), which means you can
always download the source code and play it locally without relying on our servers.
You can also inspect the source code, tweak/remix it, or include pieces of it in
your own game. (Just make sure to read and follow the
[corresponding licenses](https://github.com/albrow/elara/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).)

##### Does the game save my progress?

Yes, your progress will be saved automatically. However, if you switch
to a different computer or a different browser, your progress will be reset. See
[Do I need an account to play?](#do-i-need-an-account-to-play) for more
information.

##### Do I need an account to play?

No. You can play Elara right away without creating an account!

Future versions of the game may include account creation and sign-in options if
you want to save your progress across different computers. If included, these
will be completely optional and you can still play without an account if you
choose to do so.

##### Do I need to install the game?

Nope. Elara runs directly in your browser, so there's no need to install anything.

##### What language does Elara teach?

Elara uses a language called
[Rhai](https://rhai.rs/book/ref/index.html), which is easy to learn
and somewhat similar to
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript).

That said, when you are first learning how to code, the _key concepts_ are arguably
more important than the specific language you use. The concepts you learn
while playing Elara are universal and apply to any programming language.

##### What concepts does Elara teach?

The game covers everything you need to know get started with coding. This
includes functions, strings, loops, variables, if statements, and more!

##### How can I give feedback?

##### How can I support development?
